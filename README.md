# Computer-to-Arduino-Bluetooth
This is a repository devoted to allowing computers to interface with Arduino's through Bluetooth communication.

## Steps:
1- Pair the bluetooth module with your laptop operating system. You should enter the module's password during this operation.
2- Execute the python script and follow the instructions in the commands window.
3- If the connection is open, a GUI will show up.

## Note: 
For the RC module, it opens two windows: one with buttons to send control letters, and other that recieves directions from keyboard arrows and sends the same control letters as if you're using the buttons.
